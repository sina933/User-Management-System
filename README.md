# User-Management-System
This is a simple User Management System built using PHP. The project allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data, such as adding new users, editing existing users, deleting users, and viewing user details.
    User Registration: Users can register by providing their personal details such as name, email, and password.
    Login & Authentication: Secure login system with password hashing for authentication.
    CRUD Operations: Administrators can create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
    User Roles: Different roles (Admin/User) can be assigned to users with role-based access control (RBAC).
    User Management Interface: An easy-to-use interface for managing users with options to view user profiles and make changes
    
Technologies Used:
    PHP: Server-side programming language for handling user requests.
    MySQL: Database management system for storing user information.
    HTML, CSS: Front-end technologies for building the user interface
    JavaScript: For client-side interactions and validation.
